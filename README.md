# Hi there 👋

- Lets get this out of the way, I love food and good conversations 🍕
- I'm a Technology Enthusiast, trying to decide what to in life.
- I used to make Custom Roms for Moto G2 and the G5 Plus, now just trying out the various fields in Computer Science. I love coding in a lot of different programming languages, but C++ holds a special place in my heart.
- I also make random vector wallpapers as they seem aesthetically pleasing ❤
- Conversations are my forte (Basically I love talking and listening to new and interesting stuff😜)
